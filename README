Introduction
--
J2C will convert Java code into hopefully compileable C++ code. It works on
source level, translating Java source code constructs into their rough
equivalents in C++ . The output will be reasonably valid C++ code that looks a
lot like its Java counterpart and hopefully works mostly the same.

Download
--
The project is only available as source code for the time being. You can get it
either from Eclipse labs (https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/j2c/) or
github (https://github.com/arnetheduck/j2c).

Status
--
This project is an idea I've been wanting to try out written down in code.
Think of it as a paper napkin with some notes on, but in this case, the notes
compile and sometimes spit out working stuff. In other words, no guarantees 
and no quality control label.

This is also the first time I write an Eclipse plugin, so be nice.

Running
--
J2C comes in the form of an Eclipse plugin. I still haven't figured out the
publishing parts so you'll have run the plugin by opening the project in
Eclipse and starting a new Eclipse test instance by using the run button in the
plugin.xml overview.

Once you have the plugin running, set up your Java code as an Eclipse Java
Project. Eclipse must be able to compile your code for J2C do to its work!

Once the Java Project is set up (with all dependencies etc), you can run J2C by
right-clicking the project and choosing the Translate to C++ option.

Testing
--
The test project contains a few cases which should be handled correctly by the
translator (by correctly, I mean that they compile with g++ 4.6). You'll find
a CDT project in ctest that builds using the generated Makefile after running
the plugin on the test project.

Helping out
--
Patches and forks are most welcome, as is testing, but please report issues
unless you also attach a simple test case.

Licensing
--
The project is licensed under the Eclipse Public License 1.0.

Thanks

No animals were hurt while writing this code, but the Nightwatchman
might have sore fingers and throat from all that playing...

Have fun,
